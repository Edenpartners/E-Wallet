  further process your personal information.</P>
<P class="indent">
  3. We will only collect information that is necessary to carry out
  the identified purposes of use.</P>
<P class="indent">
  4. We will use or disclose your personal information only for the
  purposes for which it has been collected, except with your consent,
  or as required or permitted by applicable law, and we will retain
  your information only as long as necessary to fulfill those purposes.</P>
<P class="indent">
  5. We will endeavor to ensure that your personal information is
  accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</P>
<P class="indent">
  6. We will implement appropriate technical and organizational
  measures to protect your personal information.</P>
<P class="indent">

  may be publicly accessible. This includes, but is not limited to,
  your public sending address, the public address of the receiver, the
  amount sent or received, and any other data a user has chosen to
  include in a given transaction. Information stored on a blockchain
  may be public, immutable, and difficult or even impossible to remove
  or delete. Transactions and addresses may reveal information about
  the user’s identity and information can potentially be correlated
  now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law
  enforcement. Users are encouraged to review how privacy and
  transparency on the blockchain works.</P>
